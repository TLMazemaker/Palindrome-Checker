# Palindrome-Checker
This is a javascript program for checking if a user input is palindrome or not. It will also remove any special characters and whitespaces.

This program that I made will take a user input and return True if the word is Palindrome and return False if otherwise. A *Palindrome* is a term used for word that's spelled the same way forward or backward. My palindrome checker will :
- Uppercase or Lowercase
- Punctuations
- Whitespaces

The flow is as follows :
- Take a user input.
- Store the value in a variable.
- Make everything in lowercase.
- Remove punctuations and whitespaces.
- Split the input from the variable, reverse it, then join.
- Check if the input and the variable are the same.
- Return the value.
